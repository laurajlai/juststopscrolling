# juststopscrolling
Do you think you're spending too much time scrolling and too little time doing? Well, this extension is for you! 

With JSS, you can set time limits for how long you can spend on certain websites or view certain words or phrases. For example, say you think you spend too long browsing Reddit. As you spend more time interacting with Reddit posts, you'll receive periodic reminders about limiting your time until you reach the limit you set. 

It's quick and easy to use, so why not give it a go?
